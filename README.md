Thoughts regarding my work
----

- Certainly felt like I was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Nonetheless, who would've thought that writing a quiz app could be such an exercise in functional programming?  
  
- The JS is inline because that's the only way to do an in-browser transpilation. In the future, I'll probably figure out how to pre-build using `gulp`.
